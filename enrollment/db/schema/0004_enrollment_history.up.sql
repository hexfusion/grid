-- Schema for grid enrollment: 0004_enrollment_history.up.sql
-- Description: What deleting an enrollment does not erase. Every key the signer
-- has enrolled stays refused, so a deleted site's key cannot enroll again under
-- any name. A deleted name is recorded, so enrolling it again takes a token that
-- opts in.

    -- The primary key, not the code, refuses a reused key under any race.
